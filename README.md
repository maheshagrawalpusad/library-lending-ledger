ðŸ“š Library DApp: A Decentralized Lending Ledger

Description

This project is a full-stack decentralized application (DApp) for a Library Lending Ledger built on the Aptos blockchain. It provides a proof-of-concept for how a public library's lending system can be managed transparently using smart contracts. Users can borrow books by depositing AptosCoin, which is refunded upon return. The DApp's frontend allows for seamless interaction with the smart contract, showcasing a simple and effective decentralized workflow.

Vision

The vision behind this project is to create a trustless and immutable record of book transactions. By moving the lending ledger to the blockchain, we eliminate the need for a central authority to verify loans and returns. This reduces administrative overhead, ensures transparency, and uses small deposits to incentivize timely returns and reduce "no-show" instances.

Future Scope

Enhanced Book Management: 
Implement functions to update book details, track overdue books, and apply late fees that are automatically collected in the smart contract.

User Roles & Permissions:
Introduce distinct roles for librarians and regular users, with specific permissions for adding new books or managing returns.

Reservation System:
Add a reservation system that allows users to place a hold on a book that is currently borrowed.

Event-Driven UI: 
Fetch real-time data from the blockchain to display the current status of all books, including which are borrowed, available, or overdue.

Contract Address
To interact with this DApp, you must first deploy the smart contract to the Aptos Testnet. Replace the placeholder address in the frontend code with your actual deployed contract address.
